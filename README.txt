=== About ===
This template is for Blogger to showcase all of the various
data tags that are available. Each header identifies the widget's Type
and the data is referenced to that widget.

Widgets that have tags which contain arrays of data will have a header of one less
and will be indented.

We reference the new data using a custom keyword. Usually the keyword will be
a singular version of the data we are referencing

data:posts  - changes to - data:post
data:labels - changes to - data:label
data:links  - changes to - data:link

=== Installing ===
Inside of your Template tab in Blogger, on the top right click "Backup / Restore".

The theme will add a lot of widgets and modify widgets
